==================================inner join=================
select * from t1
inner join t2 on t1.id1=t2.id2 ----it gives common values in both the table for caliculation if we need to multiply the count of values in both the tables  like t1 having the count  of "number 2" twicw and in t2 if "number 2 having count thrice  then 3*2=6 so we get 6 rows for number 2"
===================================left join===================
select * from t1
left join t2 on t1.id1=t2.id2---- here in left join it will retrives the common data along with uncommon data which i spresnt in left table and it gives null values in right table
